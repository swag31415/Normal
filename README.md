# Normal
A thing I made while learning about normal numbers

It uses a genetic algorithm to generate arbitrarily large numbers with as many numbers below a limit as possible in its digits.

## For Example
The 24 digit number `286366949717456582392530` has 33 numbers under 100 encoded in its digits

## Uses
I don't know! Maybe a mathmatician can find some use for it? I'm just happy with making a cool genetic algorithm
